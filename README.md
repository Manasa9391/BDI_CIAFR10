# BDI_CIAFR10

The objective of this research is to explore the two architecture that are widely used for image classification of CIFAR 10. We would be  exploring CNN(Convolutional neural networks) and VGG(Visual Geometry Group)
to have computationally efficient architecture for classification.

We would be using Keras on Tensorflow backened to build our model progressively and  eventually reach to the best configuartion
